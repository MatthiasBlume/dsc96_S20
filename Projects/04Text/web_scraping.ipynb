    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't break anything.  Many rapid requests to smaller sites can overload the host server.\n",
    "2. Use a published API if possible - it is more robust and usually much easier!\n",
    "3. Respect the policy published at `robots.txt` \n",
    "4. Don't spoof your UserAgent (or try to trick the server into thinking you are a person)\n",
